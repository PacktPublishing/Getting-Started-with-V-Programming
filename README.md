## Introduction

Learn a new statically typed compiled programming language to build maintainable and fast software with the help of this comprehensive guide to V programming. V programming comes with high performance and simplicity, which allows software programmers to do quick and rapid prototyping of applications that scale.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for you if you are:

- a beginner who is interested in learning a programming language that comes with a quick and short learning curve
- an experienced programmer who is looking to switch to a new and better statically typed and compiled programming language
- willing to write quick and rapid prototyping of applications that scale using a new language with powerful concurrency features

## Key Features

Following are the key features of this book:

- Explore the features of the V programming language step by step with this beginner's guide
- Gain strong foundational knowledge of core programming concepts such as arrays, maps as well as structs, functions and modules
- Gain concrete understanding and working knowledge of concurrency in V and channels: An advanced concurrency pattern
- Learn how to write super-fast programs and applications that compile in a matter of seconds
- Learn how to implement a RESTful microservice from the scratch

## Book Description

A new language on the block, V comes with a promising set of features such as fast compilation and interoperability with other programming languages. This is the first ever book on the V programming language, packed with concise information and a walk through of all the features you need to know to get started with the language.

The book begins by covering the fundamentals to help you learn about the basic features of V and the suite of builtin libraries available within the V ecosystem. You'll become familiar with primitive data types, declaring variables, arrays, and maps. In addition to basic programming, you'll develop solid understanding of the building blocks of programming, including functions, structs, and modules in the V programming language.

As you advance through the chapters, you'll learn how to implement concurrency in V Programming. Also you will learn about an advanced concurrency pattern, Channels, which enables you to share memory by establishing communication among coroutines.

Finally, you'll learn how to write test cases for functions in V. This book also comes with an end-to-end project that guide you to build fast and maintainable RESTful microservice by leveraging the power of V and a bunch of builtin libraries in V.

By the end of the book, you'll be well-versed with the V programming language and be able to start writing your own programs and applications.
